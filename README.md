# scoreKeeper
A scorekeeper is used to record two individual participants' scores to determine the ultimate winner. we made this scorekeeper, especially for the ping-pong game we used Bulma framework for this project along with HTML and JavaScript files and I used inline statements instead of using separate css file which is not suggested since it is a small project I did it with in HTML itself. It is simple and easy to use..
